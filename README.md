# 🖥️ Homelab Logs

This repository documents my Hyper-V / AD homelab experiments, issues, and solutions.  
Each lab entry is stored in `[Projects](https://github.com/users/kk89home/projects/2)` with detailed steps, configurations, and resolutions.  

## 📂 Structure
- `logs/` → Lab logs by date/title  
- `template/` → Reusable lab log template  
- `projects/` → Reference documentation (environment, configs, etc.)

## 🔧 Current Setup
- Hyper-V with 3 VMs:
  - Windows 11
  - Ubuntu
  - Windows Server 2022 (AD DS, AD CS, WSUS, DNS)
